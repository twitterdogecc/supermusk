# Twitter Doge

Shall we to the Mars?

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Sapper project with Twitter Doge.

_Live Example: https://twitterdoge.cc/

### How We Created This Example

To get started with Sapper deployed with Vercel, you can use [Twitter Doge](https://github.com/twitterdogecc/supermusk) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ npx degit "sveltejs/sapper-template#webpack" my-sapper-app
```

> The only change made is to change the build script in `package.json` to be `"sapper export"`.
